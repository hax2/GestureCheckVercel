# Gemini Gesture Rating Pilot

This workspace contains a small pilot setup for testing whether Gemini can interpret gesture videos used in second-language vocabulary learning.

## Results Viewer

The repository root contains a static results viewer for GitHub Pages:

- `index.html`
- `app.js`
- `styles.css`
- `results-data.js`
- `generated-videos.html`
- `generated-videos.css`
- `assets/videos/`

To publish it, configure GitHub Pages to deploy from the `main` branch and root directory. The page will be available at:

```text
https://hax2.github.io/GestureCheck/
```

The local questionnaire in `Gesture Rating Sheet.docx` was converted into a structured prompt with seven 1-5 rating dimensions:

- iconicity
- sensorimotor imagery
- motional salience of the gesture
- emotional salience of the facial expression
- gesture complexity fit
- cultural familiarity
- enactment potential

## Human Rating Survey

The repository also contains a GitHub Pages-compatible human rating app:

- `survey.html`
- `survey.css`
- `survey.js`
- `survey-config.js`
- `all_rating_videos.json`
- `assets/rating-videos/`

Open it locally through a static server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8765
```

Then visit:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/survey.html
```

Useful URL parameters:

- `?limit=10`: show only the first 10 videos from the manifest.
- `?block=1`: show one 20-video block. Use `?block=2`, `?block=3`, etc. for the next blocks.
- `?block_size=20`: override the default block size.
- `?lang=en`, `?lang=de`, `?lang=it`, or `?lang=ja`: open the survey in English, German, Italian, or Japanese.
- `?order=fixed`: disable participant-specific randomization.
- `?participant_id=...&study_id=...&session_id=...`: identifiers are captured automatically.
- `?return=https://...`: show a completion return link after export/submission.
- `?manifest=custom.json`: use a different manifest with the same fields.

The app uses the seven 1-5 rating dimensions from the human rating rubric:

- iconicity
- sensorimotor imagery
- motional salience of the gesture
- emotional salience of the facial expression
- gesture complexity fit
- cultural familiarity
- enactment potential

Because GitHub Pages is static hosting, it cannot store submitted survey responses by itself. The included collection path is Google Apps Script writing to Google Sheets.

## Vercel Adaptive Survey Backend

The rating task can now run as a Vercel app with serverless API routes and Postgres-backed adaptive assignment. This keeps the UI as plain static files, but moves assignment and response storage into a real backend.

Backend files:

- `api/assignment.js`: returns an adaptive, quota-weighted random set of videos.
- `api/responses.js`: stores each completed video response.
- `api/status.js`: reports completed counts per gesture/language.
- `db/schema.sql`: creates the required Postgres tables.

Required environment variables:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgres://user:password@host:5432/database"
POSTGRES_SSL=true
```

Setup:

1. Create a Postgres database. Vercel Postgres, Neon, Supabase, or any hosted Postgres with a `DATABASE_URL` is fine.
2. Run `db/schema.sql` against that database.
3. Add `DATABASE_URL` and `POSTGRES_SSL=true` in the Vercel project environment variables.
4. Deploy this repository to Vercel.
5. Use a single language-specific link, for example:

```text
https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/gesture-rating-task.html?lang=de
https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/gesture-rating-task.html?lang=it
https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/gesture-rating-task.html?lang=en
```

The participant form records a standardized country-of-origin code separately from the interface language. For an Austrian German-language social-media campaign, use a tagged link such as:

```text
https://your-vercel-app.vercel.app/?block_size=20&lang=de&recruitment_source=austria_social
```

`recruitment_source` accepts letters, numbers, dots, underscores, and hyphens. The participant API also records Vercel's approximate `x-vercel-ip-country` value as `geo_country`; the application does not store the participant's IP address. Both values are stored in the existing `gesture_participants.demographics` JSON, so no database migration is required.

By default, `gesture-rating-task.js` calls `/api/assignment` for a 20-video adaptive assignment and posts each completed video to `/api/responses`. The assignment algorithm counts completed ratings by video title across all languages, prioritizes videos below the target quota of 20, and still includes randomness so order and assignment are not deterministic. Assignments are logged, but quota counts come from completed responses only, so participant dropout does not inflate completed counts.

Useful API calls:

```text
GET /api/assignment?lang=de&count=20&target_quota=20
POST /api/responses
GET /api/status?lang=de&target_quota=20
```

The status response reports each video's quota progress across all languages and includes `quota_scope: "all_languages"`. The `lang` parameter still filters completed-participant counts grouped by self-reported country of origin, approximate connection country, and recruitment source. A participant is counted as complete only after all responses in their adaptive assignment have been received. For example, participants of Austrian and German origin appear separately under `completed_participants_by_country` as `AT` and `DE`.

To force the old static block behavior for testing, add `assignment=static` or pass an explicit `block`:

```text
/gesture-rating-task.html?assignment=static&block=1&block_size=20&lang=en
```

Google Sheets setup:

1. Create a new Google Sheet.
2. Open Extensions > Apps Script.
3. Replace the default script with `google-apps-script/Code.gs`.
4. Click Deploy > New deployment.
5. Choose type: Web app.
6. Execute as: Me.
7. Who has access: Anyone.
8. Deploy and copy the Web app URL ending in `/exec`.
9. Paste that URL into `submitUrl` in `survey-config.js`.

Expected config:

```js
window.SURVEY_CONFIG = {
  submitUrl: "https://script.google.com/macros/s/YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_ID/exec",
  submitMode: "no-cors",
  submitEachResponse: true,
  completionUrl: "",
  completionCode: "GESTURE-RATING-COMPLETE",
  manifestUrl: "all_rating_videos.json",
  assetBaseUrl: "assets/rating-videos/",
  minWatchRatio: 0.5,
  blockSize: 20,
  tutorialReferenceTitles: ["04_Ball.avi", "40_Telephone.avi"],
};
```

The Apps Script creates or reuses a `responses` sheet and writes one spreadsheet row per rated video. The survey still provides CSV/JSON downloads as a backup.

With `submitEachResponse: true`, each video response is sent to Google Sheets immediately after the participant saves that video. The final screen does not resubmit the full survey in this mode. The Apps Script uses `response_id` to update an existing row if the same participant/session/video is submitted again.

For participant assignment, use separate URLs such as:

```text
https://samermakes.com/GestureCheck/survey.html?block=1
https://samermakes.com/GestureCheck/survey.html?block=2
https://samermakes.com/GestureCheck/survey.html?block=3
```

The default block size is 20 videos. Do not send the unblocked base survey URL to participants; send a block-specific URL. Language can be encoded in the same URL:

```text
https://samermakes.com/GestureCheck/survey.html?block=1&lang=it
https://samermakes.com/GestureCheck/survey.html?block=1&lang=de
```

The tutorial is step-by-step and keeps one looping reference video visible beside the category explanations. By default, block 1 sees `40_Telephone.avi`, while all other blocks see `04_Ball.avi`, so the tutorial video is not part of the participant's assigned rating block.

The rating page presents one category at a time. Participants can press `1`-`5` to select a score, `Enter` to confirm, and `Backspace` or left arrow to go back. Before saving a video, they see a review screen with all seven ratings and can edit any category.

Browser playback should use MP4 or WebM, not AVI. Convert local manifest videos into deployable MP4 assets with:

```bash
python3 scripts/build_rating_videos.py --manifest all_rating_videos.json --output-dir assets/rating-videos --jobs 4
```

## Files

- `prompts/gesture_rating_prompt.md`: prompt template based on the attached human rating sheet.
- `prompts/gesture_interpretation_probe.md`: unlabeled prompt for checking whether Gemini can infer plausible meanings without the target word.
- `pilot_videos.json`: first four Figshare videos selected for a pilot run.
- `scripts/run_gemini_gesture_pilot.py`: downloads videos from Figshare, uploads them to Gemini, asks for JSON ratings, and saves outputs.
- `scripts/validate_results.py`: validates rating-result JSON files.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies for the runner.
- `.env.example`: environment variables expected by the runner.

## Pilot Videos

The initial four videos are from the Figshare collection `Gesture video corpus`:

1. `81_Innocence.avi`
2. `89_Admission.avi`
3. `70_Sensation.avi`
4. `64_Boredom.avi`

These were chosen from the first Figshare API page available during setup. They include abstract/emotional or less directly imageable words, which should be a useful stress test for VLM interpretation.

## Running

Install dependencies:

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set the Gemini API key:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="..."
export GEMINI_MODEL="gemini-3.1-flash"
```

Preview the prompt without network or Gemini calls:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_gemini_gesture_pilot.py --dry-run --limit 1
python3 scripts/run_gemini_gesture_pilot.py --task probe --dry-run --limit 1
```

Run the first four videos with the rating prompt:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_gemini_gesture_pilot.py --limit 4
```

Run the unlabeled interpretation probe:

```bash
python3 scripts/run_gemini_gesture_pilot.py --task probe --limit 4
```

Outputs are written to `results/`:

- one `*.json` file per video with parsed model ratings
- one `*.raw.txt` file per video with the original Gemini response
- `gemini_gesture_rating.jsonl` or `gemini_gesture_probe.jsonl` with one parsed result per line

Validate rating outputs:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_results.py results
```

## Coherence Check

For the first pass, treat the run as coherent if:

- Gemini gives a concrete visual description of the gesture rather than generic comments.
- Scores line up with the visible description. For example, a simple easy-to-copy gesture should not get very low enactment potential without a clear reason.
- Ambiguity is acknowledged for abstract words when the gesture does not transparently map to the target word.
- Facial-emotion ratings are low when the face is neutral and higher only when affect is visibly present.
- The JSON parses cleanly and all scores are integers from 1 to 5.

The pilot does not establish validity against human raters. It only checks whether VLM responses are structured, interpretable, and plausible enough to justify a broader comparison.

## Notes

The JKU Sync2 link and full Figshare corpus still need network access to enumerate and download all videos. The runner already supports Figshare API URLs and local files, so manually downloaded videos can also be added to `pilot_videos.json` with a `local_path` field.
